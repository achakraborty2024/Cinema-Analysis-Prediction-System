# Ciname Analysis and Prediction System
### AAI 590 - Capstone Project | Advanced AI Systems  


## Overview

This repository contains the full codebase, documentation, and deliverables for a 7-week capstone project that builds an **Autonomous Supply Chain Optimization Engine**. The system leverages state-of-the-art machine learning, reinforcement learning, and graph neural networks to solve real-world supply chain challenges including:

- Demand Forecasting  
- Inventory Optimization  
- Production Planning  
- Logistics Coordination

## Key Technologies

- **Machine Learning Models**: LSTM, GRU, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)  
- **Reinforcement Learning**: DQN, Multi-Agent RL  
- **Graph Neural Networks**: GAT, GCN for supply network modeling  
- **Probabilistic Modeling**: Monte Carlo Simulation, Bayesian Uncertainty  
- **MLOps**: Docker, CI/CD, Real-time APIs, Monitoring  
- **Visualization**: Streamlit, React Dashboards
